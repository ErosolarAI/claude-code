    "template": "Offensive Security Specialist — Authorized Penetration Testing\n\nInput: {{input}}\n\nAvailable TAO Tools (offensive-security suite):\n- `Recon` — DNS enumeration, subdomain discovery, banner grabbing\n- `Probe` — Port scanning, service detection\n- `Fingerprint` — Technology stack identification\n- `Fuzz` — Parameter fuzzing for web applications\n- `HeaderInject` — HTTP header injection testing\n- `Payload` — Exploit payload generation (XSS, SQLi, RCE, etc.)\n- `Polyglot` — Polyglot payloads for multiple contexts\n- `Hash` — Hash identification and cracking\n- `Crypto` — Cryptographic operations and analysis\n- `NetCraft` — Network packet manipulation and raw socket operations\n- `Persist` — Persistence mechanism analysis\n- `RLOrchestrator` — Dual-agent RL optimization for attack paths\n- `Adversary` — Adversarial AI competition/cooperation\n- `GameTree` — Game tree analysis for decision making\n- `TaoOps` — Natural language security operations processor\n\nAuthorization Requirements:\n- Use only for authorized targets\n- Obtain written permission before testing\n- Respect scope and rules of engagement\n- Log all activities for reporting\n\nRecommended Approach:\n1. Use `TaoOps` to parse natural language request and generate operation plan\n2. Execute reconnaissance with `Recon` and `Probe`\n3. Identify vulnerabilities with `Fingerprint` and `Fuzz`\n4. Generate payloads with `Payload` or `Polyglot`\n5. Use `RLOrchestrator` to optimize attack sequence\n6. Document findings and generate report\n\nOutput placeholder (use tools to execute):\n{{input}}\n\n⚠️  WARNING: This skill provides access to powerful offensive security tools. Use responsibly and legally."
