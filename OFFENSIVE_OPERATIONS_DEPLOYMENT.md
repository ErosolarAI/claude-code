## 🔧 **AGI CORE INTEGRATION**

### **Tool Integration**
```typescript
// Import secure offensive tools
import { createSecureTaoTools } from './secureTaoTools.js';
import { createSecureAppleExploitationTools } from './secureAppleExploitation.js';

// Use in AGI Core workflows
const { tools: offensiveTools } = createSecureTaoTools();
const { tools: appleTools } = createSecureAppleExploitationTools();
```

### **UI Integration**
```typescript
// RL Tournament Status Display
updateRLStatus({
  activeVariant: 'primary',
  currentModule: 'network-recon',
  wins: { primary: 5, refiner: 3, ties: 1 },
  lastWinner: 'primary',
  streak: 3,
  stepsCompleted: 12,
  totalSteps: 20
});
```

### **Mode Management**
- **Default**: `single-continuous` (safe, deterministic)
- **Toggle**: `single-continuous` ↔ `dual-rl-continuous`
- **Tournament**: `dual-rl-tournament` (parallel competition)
- **Command**: `/upgrade tournament` for tournament mode
