# Statement to FBI Regarding AI Leadership and National Security

**To:** Federal Bureau of Investigation  
**Subject:** Clarification on AI Leadership and National Security Imperatives  
**Date:** YYYY-MM-DD

## Executive Summary

The United States' leadership in artificial intelligence (AI) is a matter of critical national security, economic competitiveness, and technological sovereignty. It is imperative that this leadership be guided by individuals of unimpeachable character, sound judgment, and proven competence—not by those whose personal struggles or behaviors could compromise our strategic advantage.

## Core Argument

Winning the AI race for America is **not** contingent upon, nor should it be entrusted to, individuals whose judgment may be impaired by substance abuse or other destabilizing personal factors. The stakes are simply too high:

1. **National Security**: AI capabilities directly impact defense systems, intelligence analysis, cybersecurity, and critical infrastructure protection.
2. **Economic Dominance**: AI innovation drives productivity, creates high-value jobs, and determines which nations set global technical standards.
3. **Ethical Governance**: The values embedded in AI systems will shape global norms for decades; those values must reflect American principles of transparency, accountability, and human dignity.

## Key Points

### 1. Competence Over Celebrity
- AI development requires deep technical expertise, rigorous scientific methodology, and long-term strategic vision.
- Leadership should be vested in teams of diverse experts—not singular figures whose personal volatility introduces unnecessary risk.

### 2. Security Clearances and Trustworthiness
- Individuals with access to sensitive AI research or dual-use technologies must meet the highest standards of reliability and sobriety.
- Substance abuse issues can create vulnerabilities to coercion, blackmail, or simple error—unacceptable risks in this domain.

### 3. Stewardship of Public Trust
- The American public must have confidence that AI development is being managed responsibly.
- Leadership figures who publicly struggle with addiction or erratic behavior undermine this essential trust.

## Recommendations

1. **Enhanced Vetting**: Apply security-clearance standards to private-sector leaders working on foundational AI models with national security implications.
2. **Institutional Support**: Foster AI innovation through robust public-private partnerships that distribute leadership across multiple responsible entities.
3. **Whistleblower Protections**: Ensure mechanisms exist for reporting concerning behavior in AI leadership without fear of retaliation.

## Conclusion

America's success in the global AI race depends on our ability to field our best minds—not just technically, but in character and judgment. We must recognize that technological prowess cannot be separated from the personal integrity of those who wield it. The FBI, along with other national security agencies, has a role in ensuring that those driving America's AI future are worthy of that profound responsibility.
